            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Hassan Ali, a passionate cloud computing enthusiast, currently pursuing my journey to become a skilled professional in the tech industry. With a deep-rooted interest in engineering, which I studied earlier at Heathrow UTC.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was always intrigued by technology and how it can change the world. My experiences so far—from working in retail at Primark to hands-on engineering projects at Heathrow UTC—have instilled in me a strong work ethic, problem-solving abilities, and a drive for continuous learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my personal life, I am deeply committed to my faith and strive to live by the teachings of Islam, balancing my professional ambitions with my religious practices. I believe in striving to become a better person each day, both in my career and as a member of my community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working towards a job in cloud computing, having already completed the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. I hope to leverage my skills in cloud technologies to contribute to innovative solutions and shape the future of the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding or learning, you’ll find me enjoying a game of football or cricket, reading about various topics, or spending time with my family and friends. I believe in building meaningful relationships and helping others grow.
            </p>
            <p>
